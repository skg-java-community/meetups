# Event Title

### Clojure 101: Interactive Introduction

## Topic Description

Clojure is a modern, functional Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and offers a range of interesting and unique features that can be very appealing to Java developers and therefore to our community.

Instead of traversing through slides, we will jump directly into the REPL and start exploring the language, having that way an interactive introduction to the Clojure programming language.
This talk intends to cover language basics, data structure manipulation, functional programming idioms and interop with the host language.
All concepts will be presented with code examples open for discussion.

Kostas Georgiadis (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kongeor/ , https://github.com/kongeor) our speaker for this event, is a senior software engineer with 10+ years of experience about 6 of those are on Java and the 4 most recent ones are on Clojure. Also on his day to day tasks he also writes Javascript and Python.
