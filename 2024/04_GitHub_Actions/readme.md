# Event Title

### GitHub Actions: Make them work for you!

## Topic Description

GitHub Actions offer robust and free CI/CD capabilities to streamline your development process. In this meetup, we'll dive into the core components of GitHub Actions and explore how they can be set to work for you! [Eleftherios Chrysochoidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lefterisxris/) will present and demonstrate various simple and advanced use cases! We will set up a simple CI for a Spring Boot app, then utilize GitHub secrets (e.g. Database credentials), optimize build jobs by caching .m2 dependencies (to keep usage within the free limits :P ) and collect build artifacts like Test Reports.

Additionally, we'll explore some of the best practices of GitHub Actions for maintaining an open source project, by creating build badges, setting up security scanning, automated dependency updates, adding testing coverage reports on open Pull Requests (or automatically rejecting them if coverage is getting lower), integration with Slack notifications, deploy docker images (for free!) and even develop a custom GitHub Action for even more specific needs.
