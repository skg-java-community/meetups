# Event Title

### Unlocking Observability in Apache Kafka®-Based Systems with OpenTelemetry

## Topic Description

Distributed tracing is essential for tracking requests across microservices. But when it comes to Kafka’s decoupled producers, consumers, and asynchronous processes, tracing a transaction from start to finish isn’t always straightforward.

In this talk, [Harry Kimpel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrykimpel/) will join us all the way from Munich (!!) to walk us through how to monitor Kafka-based applications using distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry. By leveraging tools like Jaeger and New Relic, we’ll uncover how to gain a full view of your microservices, even in the face of Apache Kafka’s asynchronous nature.

Join us for a live demo with a simple Java Spring-Boot app, where we’ll walk through both automatic and manual instrumentation to capture rich telemetry. We’ll also touch on infrastructure-level observability, pulling metrics and traces from Apache Kafka brokers and Apache Flink.

Ready to dive deep into boosting your system’s observability? Let’s make sure you can track and analyze every transaction, no matter how complex!
