### Dive into Vaadin: Building Modern Web Applications in Java

## Topic Description

Vaadin is a powerful Java framework for building modern web applications with a seamless user experience. Nick Giantsidis (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickgiant/) will present us the basics of Vaadin and how it simplifies web application development using the component-based structure like many JS frameworks.

For those who have worked with Swing or JavaFX, this will be a great chance to see how UI development in Java has evolved. Additionally, Vaadin integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot, enabling Java developers to create full-stack projects with ease!
