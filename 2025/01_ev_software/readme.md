### Building software to track env impact of EV ownership & Intro to Spring Shell

## Topic Description

Join us as Giorgos Gaganis ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgos-gaganis/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgos-gaganis/)) takes us on a journey through his innovative pet projects, developed to track and analyze the environmental impact and ownership of his familyâ€™s electric car.

During the session, Giorgos will share how he turned real-world challenges into practical software solutions, showcasing the power of Java and Spring Shell. Also, he will show us what the numbers reveal about actual EV ownership!

The talk will cover:
- The project's motivation, history, evolution and goals
- How the project works and what it measures
- A brief introduction to Spring Shell and its features
- Live demo of the application and one year of data analysis
- We'll end with an open Q&A where Giorgos will share his experience of using an electric car for daily family life
