# Event Title

### Spring Boot vs Fast API - The crash test!

## Topic Description

Hello Java fellas!

We are very happy to announce our next Java Meetup, in which we will be having a comparison between our very own Spring Boot vs Fast API, a very modern Python framework that has gained a lot of popularity since its launch! üéâ

## Topic
George Apostolidis (https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoapos/) will walk us through a comparison of these 2 great frameworks, to identify the strengths and trade-offs of each one! On the one hand, we have Spring Boot, a very mature Java framework, backed by many years of enterprise use and a massive ecosystem. On the other hand, we have FastAPI, a modern and rapidly growing Python framework known for its speed, simplicity, and automatic documentation! üíØ

üí° Whether you're building high-traffic enterprise systems or lightweight microservices, this meetup will give you the insights you need to choose the right tool for the job, considering performance, developer experience, scalability and more! In any case, it's a great opportunity to learn, compare, and discuss their pros and cons!
