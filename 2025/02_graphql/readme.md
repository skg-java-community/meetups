# Event Title

### GraphQL: One API to rule them all

## Topic Description

Hello Everyone!

We are happy to announce our next meetup, where we will explore the beauty of GraphQL! üéâ

## Topic
GraphQL is revolutionizing the way we build and consume APIs, offering flexibility, efficiency, and strong typing‚Äîall in a single endpoint. In this session, Dimitris Kontokostas (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkont) will break down the core concepts of GraphQL, demonstrate field resolvers and performance optimizations, and walk us through a live coding demo using Spring Boot! üéØ

If you're tired of over-fetching, under-fetching, or just wrestling with endless REST endpoints, this is the perfect time to explore how GraphQL can streamline your Java applications! üíØ
