# Event Title

### Securing Kafka Schema Registry in Java Microservices

## Topic Description

Hello Everyone!

We are happy to announce the first meetup of this season, where we will dive into Kafka Schema Registry in Java Microservices!

## Topic
Kafka payloads tend to evolve over time as systems grow and new features are added. Without proper schema management, even a small change can crash consumers and break entire pipelines!
In this event, Matthaios Stavrou (https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthaios-stavrou-95b12172) will join us to present schema evolution best practices! Matthaios is a Custom Software Engineering Associate Manager at Accenture, participating independently as part of the developer community to share his experience with Kafka schema registry and Java microservices!
In his talk, he will show us how to enforce runtime validation, how to secure Kafka registry with ACLs & RBAC, and also some hands-on with live coding demos in Spring Boot!
So, get ready to elevate your Kafka+Java skills! ðŸš€
