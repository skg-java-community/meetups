# Event Title

### From Chaos to Control: Kubernetes Operators in Practice!

## Topic Description

Hello Everyone!

We are happy to announce our next meetup, in which we will dive into the world of Kubernetes!

## Topic
Kubernetes is designed for automation, and therefore, we get lots of built-in automation out of the box for deploying and running clusters. But what if we need to extend or enhance that behaviour? That's where Operators come in!

💡 In this event, we will discover how Kubernetes Operators can transform infrastructure management from manual processes to automated, self-healing systems. We'll explore real-world scenarios, showing how operators reduce deployment times from weeks to minutes while eliminating cross-team bottlenecks!
The session will be presented by Nikos Ntemkas | Senior API Engineer @Vodafone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-ntemkas-34093684/) and George Binas | API Engineer @Vodafone (https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-binas-1b51a1105/) who will cover Kubernetes fundamentals, the operator pattern, and practical implementation using both Java Operators SDK and GoLang. You'll see the same operator built in both languages, and understand when to use each approach.

🎯 The topic is ideal for anyone interested in modern infrastructure automation, from developers curious about Kubernetes, to engineers already managing cloud-native systems. 🚀
